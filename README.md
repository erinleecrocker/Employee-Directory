# Employee-Directory
<br /> 
        
## Description :
    
The goal of this project was to create an employee directory with React. This required breaking up the application's UI into components, managing component state, and responding to user events. This was done  for employees or managers who would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees.
